Project Goal
Build and evaluate supervised classification models to predict the species of Iris flowers.

Dataset
Iris Dataset from sklearn.datasets
150 samples, 4 features, 3 classes (Setosa, Versicolor, Virginica)
Steps Performed
Data preprocessing (scaling features with StandardScaler)
Train/Test split (80/20)
Model training:
Logistic Regression
Random Forest
Model evaluation:
Accuracy, Precision, Recall, F1 Score
Confusion Matrix
ROC-AUC curves
Comparison of models to select the best performer
Results
Logistic Regression: Good accuracy, handles linear relationships well
Random Forest: Slightly better accuracy, handles non-linear relationships
How to Run
Open ML_Classification_Iris_Project.ipynb in Google Colab or Jupyter Notebook
Run all cells
Plots and metrics will display automatically
